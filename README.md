## 1. About 
Hello! My name is Nemat and Iâ€™m currently studying software engineering. I've developed a portfolio to showcase my software projects and UX/UI design skills 

Website: https://nematbhullar.netlify.app

## 2. Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

This installs a package and any dependencies.

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
